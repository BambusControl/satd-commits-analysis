# SATD Commits Analysis

Supporting sources for analyzing self-admitted technical debt (SATD)
and its correlation with changes in lines, files,
and the delta of unit complexity within a commit.

## Source data

Data extraction was performed using the [SATD GIT Extractor](https://github.com/BambusControl/satd-git-extractor) project.
The tool extracts additional data for the [source dataset](https://github.com/yikun-li/satd-different-sources-data) of another SATD study.[^1]
